### Projects

**[Jix](https://github.com/rmst/jix)** (2025-now)
A tool enabling functional, declarative system and development configurations to be written in JavaScript. Internally, it constructs a Merkle-DAG of configuration units called "effects" (a generalization of [Nix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_(package_manager)) derivations). It's more powerful than YAML-based configuration tools (e.g. Ansible, docker-compose) and more ergonomic and flexible than [Nix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_(package_manager)).

**[QuickJS-x](https://github.com/rmst/quickjs-x)** (2025-now)
A wrapper around [Fabrice Bellard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabrice_Bellard)'s Javascript engine [QuickJS](https://github.com/bellard/quickjs) adding Node.js module loading and shims for parts of the Node.js standard library.


### Past Projects (*Selection*)

**[Uniton](https://github.com/rmst/uniton)** (2021) · [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BHYa1Ycb-A)
A Python package to control the Unity game engine. It automatically translates function calls from Python to Unity/C# and dispatches them asynchronously. It also coordinates the Python and Unity/C# garbage collectors.

**[RLRD](https://github.com/rmst/rlrd)** (2020)
Code accompanying our [Reinforcement Learning with Random Delays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02966) paper with an implementation our Delay-Correcting Actor-Critic algorithm in Pytorch.

**[RTRL](https://github.com/rmst/rtrl)** (2019)
Code accompanying our [Real-Time Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04448) paper with implementations of Real-Time Actor-Critic and Soft Actor-Critic in Pytorch.

**[DDPG](https://github.com/rmst/ddpg)** (2016)
The first open reproduction of the [Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971) algorithm by Lillicrap, et al., 2015, in both MATLAB with manually-coded gradient computation and also the brand new (at the time) Tensorflow automatic differentiation framework.


### Hobby Projects (*Selection*)

**[Yoke](https://github.com/rmst/yoke)** (2018-2021)
Android app turning the phone into a gamepad for Windows/Mac/Linux. Low latency communication over Wifi via UDP.
