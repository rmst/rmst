## Projects

**[Jix](https://github.com/rmst/jix)** (2025-now)
A tool enabling functional, declarative system and development configurations to be written in JavaScript. Internally, it constructs a Merkle-DAG of configuration units called "effects" (a generalization of Nix derivations). It's more powerful than YAML-based configuration tools (e.g. Ansible, docker-compose) and more ergonomic and flexible than Nix.

**[QuickJS-x](https://github.com/rmst/quickjs-x)** (2025-now)
A wrapper around Fabrice Bellard's Javascript engine QuickJS adding Node.js module loading and shims for parts of the Node.js standard library.


## Past Projects

**[Uniton](https://github.com/rmst/uniton)** (2021) · [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BHYa1Ycb-A)
A Python package to control the Unity game engine. It automatically translates function calls from Python to Unity/C# and dispatches them asynchronously. It also coordinates the Python and Unity/C# garbage collectors.

**[RTRL](https://github.com/rmst/rtrl)** (2019)
Code accompanying our Real-Time Reinforcement Learning paper with implementations of Real-Time Actor-Critic and Soft Actor-Critic in Python and Pytorch.

**[DDPG](https://github.com/rmst/ddpg)** (2016)
The first open reproduction of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm by Lillicrap, et al., 2015, in both MATLAB with manually-coded gradient computation and also the brand new (at the time) Tensorflow automatic differentiation framework.
